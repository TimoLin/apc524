Usage of the monotonicity checking algorithm:

Generated executable through 'make': check_monotonic
Command: ./check_monotonic
Outputs: The following are printed to the terminal 
	 - matrix used to test code
	 - array containing strictly monotonic progress variables (C)
	 - array containing linear regression slopes for above C
	 - array indicating the best C, other monotonic C, and non-monotonic C 

Files: monocheck_tester.cc 
       monocheck.h
       monocheck.cc
       maxslope.h
       linregression.h
       linregression.cc
       matrix.h
       matrix.cc
       Makefile

Functionality: 

monocheck_tester.cc: Includes the main function that runs the monotonicity check and selects the most monotonic progress progress variable based on the largest linear regression slope magnitude.

monocheck.h/.cc: This class is used to determine the strictly monotonic progress variables. More info is found in the comments of the file.

maxslope.h: This abstract class provides virtual methods that determine the most monotonic progress variable as implemented by inheriting classes.

linregression.h/.cc: This class inherits from the MaxSlope class. It has methods to calculate the linear regression slopes for strictly monotonic progress variables and select the progress variable with the largest magnitude slope as the best.

matrix.h/.cc: This class implements a 2D matrix in a 1D array.

Makefile: Used to compile all files.
